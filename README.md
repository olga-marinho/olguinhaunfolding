### O.LGUINHA UNFOLDING
This interactive digital project presents not only Olga Marinho’s creative works, but also her entire journey and evolution as a designer in constant formation.
It is born from the idea that what truly matters is not only the final outcome, but the process and path that lead there — every experience, discovery, and reflection that contributes to building a unique professional identity.

The website unfolds as an interactive timeline that captures key moments since 2017 — encompassing projects, training experiences, quotes, and reflections — inviting the viewer to follow the designer’s ongoing development.

Technically, the platform is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a responsive grid layout and dynamic dropdown components.
Its script automatically detects the current page (for example, 2023.html or 2024.html) and loads only the corresponding data from a structured JSON file, dynamically generating the multimedia content — including images, descriptions, and contextual information.
